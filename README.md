# Binary-Classification
This repository contains files for the "Binary Classification with Machine
Learning" project. In this project, I was given a training set of 9,000
samples and 205 features, and had to build a model to classify the dataset as
best as possible. The steps for this task consisted of data preparation
(imputing missing values, feature selection) and building the model (training
a classifier, testing accuracy).
